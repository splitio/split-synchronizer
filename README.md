# Split Synchronizer 
[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.com/splitio/split-synchronizer.svg?branch=master)](https://api.travis-ci.com/splitio/split-synchronizer)

## Overview
By default, Split’s SDKs keep segment and split data synchronized as users navigate across disparate systems, treatments, and conditions. However, some languages, do not have a native capability to keep a shared local cache of this data to properly serve treatments. For these cases, we built the Split Synchronizer.

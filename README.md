## Overview

### Split Synchronizer
By default, Split’s SDKs keep segment and feature flag data synchronized as users navigate across disparate systems, treatments, and conditions. However, some languages, do not have a native capability to keep a shared local cache of this data to properly serve treatments. For these cases, we built the Split Synchronizer service.

This tool coordinates the sending and receiving of data to a remote datastore that all of your processes can share to pull data for the evaluation of treatments. Out of the box, Split supports Redis as a remote datastore, and so the Split Synchronizer uses Redis as the cache for your SDKs when evaluating treatments. It also posts impression and event data and metrics generated by the SDKs back to Split’s servers, for exposure in the web console or sending to the data integration of your choice. The Synchronizer service runs as a standalone process in dedicated or shared servers and it does not affect the performance of your code, or Split’s SDKs.

### Split Proxy
The Split Proxy enables you to deploy a service in your own infrastructure that behaves like Split's servers and is used by both server-side and client-side SDKs to synchronize the flags without connecting to Split's actual backend directly.

This tool reduces connection latencies from the SDKs to the Split server to the SDKs transparently, and when a single connection is required from a private network to the outside for security reasons.

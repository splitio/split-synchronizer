// Right now, proxy mode has impressions, events & telemetry refresh rate properties. It's not really clear whether they add value or not
// to have such behaviour, but in order to not break everything now, we'll try to maintain that behavior.
// In order to do so, we're replacing the prevoius struct with multiple nested maps for 2 channels.
// An explicit one, which will capture incoming data from POST requests and an implicit one managed by a worker pool which will have N goroutines
// blocked there waiting for data to be pushed into so that they can post it to our BE.
// An async task will periodically flush the queue, by moving those elements into the worker pool's one. (we're using pointers
// the cost of copying those structs everywhere).
// The worker pool now defines the level of concurrency when posting data
// The size of the incoming  & worker pool channels, define the amount of impression posts that can be kept in memory
